Static versioned content & Demonstration pages
==============

Output target from repo 'setup-front-end' which is available at http://github.com/SquadraCorse/setup-front-end

In that repo you will be able to build your front-end with Grunt which will deliver these documentation pages and their static versioned content (css/js/img for CDN). 

The result files are available at http://squadracorse.github.io/build-frontend
